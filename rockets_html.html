                    The Falcon 9 is SpaceX's workhorse rocket, designed for reliable and cost-effective transport 
                    to Earth orbit and beyond. What makes it truly special is its ability to land back on Earth 
                    after launching payloads into space, making it the first orbital-class reusable rocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With over 200 successful landings, Falcon 9 has revolutionized spaceflight economics. It regularly 
                    delivers cargo and crew to the International Space Station, launches satellites for commercial 
                    customers, and has become the most frequently launched rocket in the world.

                    Falcon Heavy is currently the most powerful operational rocket in the world. It's essentially 
                    three Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, creating a beast capable of lifting enormous payloads 
                    to orbit. All three boosters are designed to return to Earth and land for reuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rocket made headlines with its first launch in 2018, when it sent Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster 
                    into space with a mannequin driver named "Starman." Beyond the spectacle, Falcon Heavy serves 
                    critical missions including launching large satellites and supporting deep space missions.

                    Starship is SpaceX's next-generation fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both 
                    crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond. It's the largest and most powerful 
                    rocket ever built, standing at nearly 120 meters tall when stacked with its Super Heavy booster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike previous rockets, both stages of Starship are designed to be completely reusable. The 
                    Super Heavy booster returns to the launch site where it can be caught by mechanical arms on the 
                    launch tower - a feat achieved for the first time in October 2024. This makes Starship crucial 
                    for NASA's Artemis program and SpaceX's vision of colonizing Mars.

                    The Space Launch System is NASA's powerful deep space rocket designed to return humans to the 
                    Moon and eventually take them to Mars. It's the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built, 
                    surpassing even the legendary Saturn V that took astronauts to the Moon during the Apollo program.

                    SLS made its debut with the Artemis I mission in November 2022, successfully sending an uncrewed 
                    Orion spacecraft around the Moon. The rocket uses a combination of liquid hydrogen and oxygen for 
                    its core stage, along with solid rocket boosters derived from the Space Shuttle program. While 
                    not reusable like SpaceX's vehicles, SLS provides unmatched capability for heavy payloads to 
                    deep space destinations.

                Each of these rockets represents different philosophies in space exploration. SpaceX focuses on 
                reusability and rapid iteration, while NASA's SLS prioritizes proven technology and deep space
