                    The International Space Station represents one of humanity's greatest achievements in space - 
                    a continuously inhabited laboratory orbiting 400 kilometers above Earth. Since the year 2000, 
                    astronauts from around the world have lived and worked aboard the ISS, conducting experiments 
                    that would be impossible on Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft have become vital to ISS operations, regularly delivering 
                    supplies, equipment, and scientific experiments. The Dragon capsule was the first commercial 
                    spacecraft to dock with the ISS, marking a new era where private companies work alongside space 
                    agencies to support orbital operations.

                <h3>Commercial Crew Program</h3>
                <img src="crewdragon.jpg" alt="Crew Dragon spacecraft" class="mission-img" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw">
                <p>
                    In May 2020, SpaceX made history by launching astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the 
                    International Space Station aboard Crew Dragon. This was the first crewed orbital spaceflight 
                    launched from the United States since 2011, and the first ever by a private company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The success of this mission, known as Demo-2, restored America's ability to send astronauts to 
                    space without relying on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Since then, Crew Dragon has flown multiple 
                    operational missions, carrying both NASA astronauts and private citizens to orbit. Each mission 
                    demonstrates the reliability and safety of commercial spaceflight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's remarkable about Crew Dragon is its complete automation - the spacecraft can navigate to 
                    and dock with the ISS without pilot input, though astronauts can take manual control if needed. 
                    The capsule's touchscreen controls represent a dramatic departure from the switches and buttons 
                    of earlier spacecraft.

                <h3>Starlink Global Internet Constellation</h3>
                <img src="SPACEX-STARLINK-SATELLITES-CONSTELLATION.jpeg" alt="Starlink satellites in orbit" class="mission-img" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Starlink is SpaceX's ambitious project to provide high-speed internet access to every corner 
                    of Earth using a constellation of thousands of small satellites in low Earth orbit. Each Falcon 9 
                    launch can deploy up to 60 Starlink satellites at once, and the constellation has grown to become 
                    the largest satellite network ever created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes Starlink unique is its scale and approach. Traditional communication satellites orbit 
                    at 35,000 kilometers altitude, creating delays in signal transmission. Starlink satellites orbit 
                    at just 550 kilometers, dramatically reducing latency and making services like video calls and 
                    online gaming possible even in remote locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mission has proven invaluable during natural disasters and conflicts, providing internet 
                    connectivity when traditional infrastructure fails. From rural communities to ships at sea, 
                    Starlink is connecting people who previously had limited or no internet access. The project also 
                    generates revenue that helps fund SpaceX's more ambitious goals like Mars colonization.

            <h3>The Impact of These Missions</h3>
            <p>
                Each of these missions represents a fundamental shift in how we approach space. The ISS shows us 
                that humans can live and work in space for extended periods. The Commercial Crew Program proves 
                that private companies can safely transport astronauts. Starlink demonstrates that space-based 
                services can benefit people on Earth right now, not just in some distant future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these achievements are building the foundation for an even more ambitious future - one 
                where space travel is routine, where lunar bases support scientific research, and where missions 
                to Mars are not just dreams but concrete plans in development.
